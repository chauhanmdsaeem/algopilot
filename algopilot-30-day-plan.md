# AlgoPilot — 30-Day Build Plan (v1.0)

This breaks the roadmap from your project doc into a day-by-day plan. Each day lists **what to build**, **git branch to use**, and a **sample commit message** so you practice real workflow habits from day one.

> Rule of thumb: one small commit per meaningful change. Don't wait until "everything works" to commit.

---

## VS Code Setup (Do This Before Day 1)

Since you'll be writing all the code in VS Code, install these extensions first:

- **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** and **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** — frontend
- **Extension Pack for Java** + **Spring Boot Extension Pack** — backend (run/debug buttons, endpoint mapping view)
- **GitLens** — inline blame/history, very useful while learning Git
- **Thunder Client** or **REST Client** — test Spring Boot APIs without leaving the editor

Workflow tip: keep an integrated terminal split open for `git status`, `git add`, `git commit` instead of switching to a separate terminal app — it keeps the "small commit per change" habit easy to stick to since you see your diffs right there.

## After Day 30 (v2.0 ideas, when ready)
AI code hints, AI solution explanations, daily challenges, discussion forum, company-wise problem lists, live contests, real code execution, certificates, badges.

## Tips for Sticking to This
- If a day's task overflows, it's fine — shift by a day rather than skipping the commit discipline.
- Always branch off `develop`, never commit auth/DB secrets, and open a PR (even solo) before merging into `develop`.
- Tag milestones (`v0.1`, `v0.2`, `v1.0`) — it's great practice and looks good on GitHub.
